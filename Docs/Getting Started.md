# Getting Started
It's pretty hard to use a bot if the bot doesn't exist. So how about we make one of em, shall we?

To start, go to the [Discord Developers Apps Page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and create an app.

You can see here how it should look to start with:

The name is the only thing needed. However, in this example, you can see I also add an avatar, which is fully optional.

Next, make the account a bot account. There should be a button saying "Make this a bot user" or something similar. Click it and wait. Now, grab the token from the bot and save it. 

**MAJOR WARNING** Do not give your token to ANYONE you don't trust greatly. The only exception to this would be bot devs and such. If you are working alone, the token should never go to anyone else.

You can find the token here (don't even bother trying to use this one, it will be reset.

Use this to replace the 'token', found in my examples. To add the bot to the server, use the **Client ID** section and use the [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html)

There you go, now you should have your bot account and be ready to start using everything.
